After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [8] S. A. Abou-Donia. Importance of Fermented Milks and Related Cheese, Egyptian Diet.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [37] P.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [27] H.

Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [19] M.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [23] M.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [17] M.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa. Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [35] T.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [25] R.

Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [3] S.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [19] M. Korish, A. M. AbdElhamid.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [7] S.A. Abou-Donia. Geographical distribution and historical development of Ancient Egyptian dairy products.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [31] N. M. Wahba, A. S. Ahmed, Z. Z. Ebraheim.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [27] H.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W. M.Bakr,N. F. Gomaa.

Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [20] Z.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [14] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian Domiati soft white cheese.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [4] S.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [28] F.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [26] H.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9].",pa4,1,"1.072501704536145, 0.7954123234500485, 0.9329909943406911, 0.7721626088495102, 0.851942538906736, 0.7031204700469971, 0.746587805463107, 0.7233860275794054, 0.7505275481987277, 0.7543482139073913, 0.8446371038841766, 0.80295579474539, 0.732107393490776, 0.7166911241226097, 0.7199251862967725, 0.7814827150515086, 0.7177132253103814, 0.7172927741461358, 0.7753000558812901, 0.6714541735441637, 0.6793175793759462, 0.7527530473334881, 0.6683851168108544, 0.7949521770311515, 0.7006057900982362, 0.6980347623056309, 0.6805731865370984, 0.6487880602728305, 0.6688664936933146, 0.7281117754101444, 0.7640446720538117, 0.7328746265556706, 0.7763065263377731, 0.6172038875457824, 0.6516858894346688, 0.6340553516954135, 0.6899539897000284, 0.6371166352810764, 0.7563903764952968, 0.7156155636661259, 0.7119745492315497, 0.706780429891683, 0.6275897312368559, 0.6405148271302501, 0.7047105375616101, 0.6675661007901896, 0.6166509540823275, 0.6827556299134594, 0.6979107605096717, 0.7298005549807703, 0.5130064487457275, 0.6083354592648353, 0.6257313389883488, 0.529132265645263, 0.5808097468101223, 0.5249516009961283, 0.49032744320740085, 0.5203720690038357, 0.5560816723429322, 0.4428390920440212",1

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [17] M. H.Abd-El-Salam, S. El-Shibiny, H. A. El-Alamy. Production of skim milk (Kariesh cheese) from ultra-filtered reconstituted milk. Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 12, 111-115, 1984. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S. A.Awad, B.Gehan, J.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W. M.Bakr,N. F. Gomaa. Bacteriological Quality of Some Dairy Products (Kariesh Cheese and Ice Cream). Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [25] R. M. Badawi, M. K.Kebary. Accelerated ripening of cheese by partial lyophilized lactococci Menofiya Journal of Agriculture Research,Vol. 21, 63-81, 1996. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | [1] J. A. Phelan, J. Renaud, P. F. Fox. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology, Chapman & Hall Publishers, London, 1993. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [23] M. E. Aly.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [29] N.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [32] C. L. Randazzo, S. De Luca, A. Todaro, C. Restuccia, C. M. Lanza, G. Spagna, C. Caggia.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [4] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian fresh fermented milk products.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [14] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian Domiati soft white cheese. New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 21, 167-190, 1986. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | [20] Z. A. A. Ghada, M. H. Alia, S. Soha Al, N. A. Magdy, F. S. Mohamed. Chemical, Nutritional and Microbiological Evaluation of Some Egyptian Soft Cheeses.

International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [13] Z. H. Iskandar. Annales du Service des Antiques de Egypt. IskandarPublisher, Cairo, Egypt, 1942. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful","0.8307574987411499, 0.74083411693573, 0.7334469556808472, 0.7316813468933105, 0.7308204770088196, 0.7259629964828491, 0.7107340097427368, 0.694291889667511, 0.6900731921195984, 0.6768302321434021, 0.6746642589569092, 0.6718037128448486, 0.6536140441894531, 0.6463673114776611, 0.6455919742584229, 0.6381202936172485, 0.6332895755767822, 0.6298938989639282, 0.6295486688613892, 0.6082355976104736, 0.6046695709228516, 0.6046116948127747, 0.6036415100097656, 0.6030253767967224, 0.5975263118743896, 0.5933108329772949, 0.5918645858764648, 0.5857223272323608, 0.5773941278457642, 0.5767800807952881, 0.5757778882980347, 0.5747092962265015, 0.5692753791809082, 0.5666928291320801, 0.5647701621055603, 0.5643373727798462, 0.5641196370124817, 0.5588306188583374, 0.558332085609436, 0.5496572256088257, 0.548688530921936, 0.5463116765022278, 0.5456011891365051, 0.5454469919204712, 0.5443270206451416, 0.5362694263458252, 0.5351808071136475, 0.5340308547019958, 0.5257923603057861, 0.5244765281677246, 0.5220463871955872, 0.5180938243865967, 0.5173827409744263, 0.5151879191398621, 0.5151692032814026, 0.5150838494300842, 0.5069710612297058, 0.4997203052043915, 0.4763126075267792, 0.3760015368461609","11.878602995234257, 6.714044194817729, 10.213819228985212, 5.97330436220112, 6.083187206464384, 10.523831372049434, 9.400309848464758, 14.711515301797528, 5.123964342656132, 11.868645939302537, 7.101470413145297, 4.162301786796587, 5.0827365552655905, 5.879288537227873, 8.216672040098704, 1.3801241438781744, 3.4937723272534225, 6.188113270111863, 4.735057020291199, 4.1725802271953025, 5.244690300400159, 5.645545663745679, 4.024263489231863, 1.2942654651948722, 8.073616723676409, 4.357574577447332, 1.2592128028032763, 14.929027177533499, 7.004441898692608, 6.125845120696697, 11.298922381081567, 11.171855819021921, 3.1206941089029163, 1.1681410382863517, 3.6144861961328685, 7.509055958946167, 9.223500024860414, 8.408742428257382, 4.116591400881563, 6.246778879425232, 9.489946926005409, 7.891695012764775, 6.490373682980988, 4.966931361322233, 3.9152226257842404, 4.50781453183798, 5.150945910871375, 4.504745539040011, 6.380337316136806, 7.849773797777113, 7.70401226799594, 5.368887863092567, 0.0, 10.966561545138784, 6.667995051891135, 7.870664220773149, 8.386687437184522, 2.009939848553789, 10.959484199705686, 9.029045557895055","indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13].

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss.

Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [22] N.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [35] T.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [21] O.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [28] F. A. Exterkate, G. J. C. M.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days.

Improving the textural properties of Egyptian Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids.

The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [35] T.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [16] Y.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 18, 143-158, 1990. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [1] J. A. Phelan, J. Renaud, P. F. Fox.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [28] F.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C).

Accelerated ripening of cheese by partial lyophilized lactococci Menofiya Journal of Agriculture Research,Vol. 21, 63-81, 1996. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C).

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process.

Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [3] S.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [34] A.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Recently, studies | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [35] T.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries).

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa. Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese. MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [22] N.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [17] M.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [20] Z.

The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [34] A. E. Abou-Dawood,S. M. Abdou.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [21] O.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [30] O.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [17] M.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 12, 111-115, 1984. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [35] T.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [20] Z. A. A. Ghada, M. H. Alia, S.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [19] M. Korish, A. M. AbdElhamid. Improving the textural properties of Egyptian Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids. International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [25] R.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E. Johnson, N. F. Olson. Accelerated ripening of Gouda cheese. II.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [32] C.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid.

Improving the textural properties of Egyptian Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids. International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [22] N.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [30] O. M. Salem, A. I. Hamed, K. M. K. Kebary, A. S. El-Sisi. Influence of attenuated lactococci on the quality of Kariesh cheese made by direct acidification. Egyptian Journal Dairy Science,Vol. 25, 253-260, 1997. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [20] Z.

Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [16] Y.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [14] S.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [18] M.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [16] Y.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [20] Z.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

AbdElhamid. Improving the textural properties of Egyptian Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids. International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [9] S.

New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 21, 167-190, 1986. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [35] T.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [8] S. A. Abou-Donia.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | [11] S. A. Abou-Donia. Geographical distribution and historical development of ancient Egyptian dairy products, 7th Egyptian Conference for Dairy Science and Technology, 23, 1998. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [32] C. L. Randazzo, S. De Luca, A.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [6] S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [26] H.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [3] S.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1].

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science,Vol. 1, 141-147, 1973. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [8] S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [2] N.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [30] O. M. Salem, A. I. Hamed, K. M.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [16] Y.

The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [23] M.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [35] T.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | [1] J. A. Phelan, J. Renaud, P. F. Fox.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [38] T.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products.

MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [4] S.

Improving the textural properties of Egyptian Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids. International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | [6] S. A. Abou-Donia.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [23] M. E. Aly. Utilization of freeze-shocked lactobacilli for enhancing flavour development of Ras cheese.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese.

Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

Improving the textural properties of an acid-coagulated (Kariesh) cheese using exopolysaccharide producing cultures. LWT Food Science and Technology, Vol. 38, 843-847, 2005. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [16] Y. A. Moustafa. Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese. MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [23] M. E. Aly.

Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [25] R.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | [8] S. A. Abou-Donia. Importance of Fermented Milks and Related Cheese, Egyptian Diet.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [17] M. H.Abd-El-Salam, S. El-Shibiny, H. A. El-Alamy.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [9] S. M. El-Gendy. Fermented Foods of Egypt and the Middle East. Journal Food Protection, Vol. 46, 358-367, 1983. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [35] T.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa. Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese. MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | [7] S.A. Abou-Donia. Geographical distribution and historical development of Ancient Egyptian dairy products. Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 27, 359-368, 1999a | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [22] N. H. Ahmed, M.A. El-Soda, A. N. Hassan, Frank J. Improving the textural properties of an acid-coagulated (Kariesh) cheese using exopolysaccharide producing cultures. LWT Food Science and Technology, Vol. 38, 843-847, 2005. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [11] S. A. Abou-Donia.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [31] N.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [30] O. M. Salem, A. I. Hamed, K. M. K. Kebary, A. S. El-Sisi. Influence of attenuated lactococci on the quality of Kariesh cheese made by direct acidification.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [16] Y. A. Moustafa. Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese. MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W. M.Bakr,N. F. Gomaa.

International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [22] N.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [28] F. A. Exterkate, G. J. C. M. Veer, J. De Stadhouders.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [22] N.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C).

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [2] N.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [29] N.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [27] H.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [14] S.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | [13] Z.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [25] R.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [17] M.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [8] S.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Recently, studies | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | [13] Z.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [30] O.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [22] N.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W. M.Bakr,N. F. Gomaa.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [34] A.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [8] S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese.

Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [30] O.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [31] N. M. Wahba, A. S. Ahmed, Z. Z. Ebraheim.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [8] S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people.",pa25,2,"1.008297219101038, 1.0134381688077532, 1.0093727557981642, 0.9310996647184944, 0.9548771628515037, 0.8838604939593367, 0.9497287558817349, 0.8948021308002391, 0.8639536834914745, 0.8731288829335655, 0.8208074581052328, 0.8289078826218311, 0.8007471409132622, 0.8550991016963927, 0.8587115992623393, 0.8082241750819501, 0.8242091060556553, 0.7710326848504743, 0.7310530161609251, 0.7072158834982897, 0.8322617923175073, 0.8057634541989439, 0.786450130623614, 0.7403325464690701, 0.7364971798335134, 0.8233998464643564, 0.7222061018663616, 0.6935706132268777, 0.8003260075244577, 0.6873230212974826, 0.6952125108112734, 0.612456738948822, 0.8152085416437254, 0.6623324636869988, 0.64846693729113, 0.7068430008733385, 0.6217171373159838, 0.6703311948009212, 0.6401792915609652, 0.7133219489422581, 0.6335695624028361, 0.5788657665252686, 0.6239151269696114, 0.6462294680348398, 0.6397662188875132, 0.6463723502088667, 0.6400919622752523, 0.6423279323320521, 0.6266291924018139, 0.6041328792028985, 0.6267606366821279, 0.5945920274133529, 0.6006444647275513, 0.5980922561015133, 0.6619544068120524, 0.555963832932708, 0.5427750207059023, 0.5784496359360667, 0.4971812130239163, 0.36994147300720215",1

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.7756669521331787, 0.6056675314903259, 0.5402956008911133, 0.5345653295516968, 0.5301638841629028, 0.5256075859069824, 0.5157639980316162, 0.5078227519989014, 0.5075019598007202, 0.505555272102356, 0.5050820112228394, 0.5044808387756348, 0.5028117895126343, 0.49965038895606995, 0.4984528720378876, 0.498124361038208, 0.49223989248275757, 0.48813602328300476, 0.4876832962036133, 0.4863632321357727, 0.48150721192359924, 0.47100168466567993, 0.4705984592437744, 0.4683905243873596, 0.4677395224571228, 0.46550071239471436, 0.4645436406135559, 0.4613037407398224, 0.46092838048934937, 0.4602198600769043, 0.45796531438827515, 0.4577551484107971, 0.4543391168117523, 0.45317357778549194, 0.45246368646621704, 0.4509630799293518, 0.4508071541786194, 0.44332432746887207, 0.44154274463653564, 0.43910646438598633, 0.4297735095024109, 0.42915430665016174, 0.42843878269195557, 0.42703312635421753, 0.42404448986053467, 0.4168013036251068, 0.41653332114219666, 0.41526663303375244, 0.41338974237442017, 0.40776264667510986, 0.40413713455200195, 0.40166333317756653, 0.3983169198036194, 0.3925091624259949, 0.38684600591659546, 0.3861612379550934, 0.37840062379837036, 0.3716268539428711, 0.36036959290504456, 0.33130860328674316","22.06349748340878, 0.0, 0.30223164430897437, 3.1119389865884317, 0.0, 4.672415631178195, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.270684138816401, 1.1269536329594978, 1.194510800121812, 0.0, 1.164590775751144, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.27893733779822816, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4841981452563407, 0.6420754409096951, 1.1269536329594978, 0.0, 0.47576045975103465, 0.0, 1.1090328201378319, 0.0, 1.5532590909570356, 0.0, 1.531009747370736, 2.275969988674486, 1.0748483505405702, 1.6070719342801016, 0.0, 0.0, 1.9892918775739419, 2.4417798848180863, 0.27893733779822816, 2.465081260241335, 0.0, 2.3915743877426077, 2.0533712665789587, 2.071563642296747, 1.845759057721453, 2.2435879723963414, 2.5185964453174807, 2.4288858253666232, 2.5254271936176593, 2.1781102507353296, 4.460659065696314, 1.5810526152993991, 1.618172225885678, 3.390498248023221, 2.499809375262209, 2.9720332705135064, 2.1240229140324605, 2.543016704452956, 2.0658735562434467, 1.5964971095038498",The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful,pa26,1,"1.2169369018013543, 0.6056675314903259, 0.5463402337772928, 0.5968041092834654, 0.5301638841629028, 0.6190558985305463, 0.5157639980316162, 0.5078227519989014, 0.5075019598007202, 0.530968954878684, 0.5276210838820293, 0.528371054778071, 0.5028117895126343, 0.5229422044710929, 0.4984528720378876, 0.498124361038208, 0.49223989248275757, 0.4937147700389693, 0.4876832962036133, 0.4863632321357727, 0.49119117482872604, 0.48384319348387383, 0.4931375319029644, 0.4683905243873596, 0.4772547316521435, 0.46550071239471436, 0.48672429701631253, 0.4613037407398224, 0.49199356230849006, 0.4602198600769043, 0.4885855093356899, 0.5032745481842869, 0.4758360838225637, 0.485315016471094, 0.45246368646621704, 0.4509630799293518, 0.49059299173009824, 0.49215992516523377, 0.4471214913925002, 0.48840808959081305, 0.4297735095024109, 0.4769857944050139, 0.46950620802353477, 0.4684643992001525, 0.4609596710149637, 0.46167306307303363, 0.46690525004854627, 0.4638443495410849, 0.4638982862467734, 0.45132485168981645, 0.49335031586592826, 0.4332843854835545, 0.43068036432133294, 0.4603191273864593, 0.4368421934218396, 0.44560190336536354, 0.4208810820790196, 0.4224871880319302, 0.4016870640299135, 0.36323854547682016",1

Origin, history and manufacturing process of Egyptian dairy products: An overview. Journal of Food Science and Technology,Vol. 5, 51-62, 2008 | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [7] S.A.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [28] F. A. Exterkate, G. J. C. M. Veer, J. De Stadhouders.

Netherland Milk Dairy JournalVol. 41, 307-320, 1987. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid. New type of Domiati cheese of potential benefit to people with high blood cholesterol, Journal of Dairy Research, Vol. 59, 89-94, 1992. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [34] A.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E. Johnson, N. F. Olson. Accelerated ripening of Gouda cheese. II.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin.

LWT Food Science and Technology,Vol. 25, 438-441, 1992. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [13] Z. H. Iskandar. Annales du Service des Antiques de Egypt. IskandarPublisher, Cairo, Egypt, 1942. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.7615598440170288, 0.7576577067375183, 0.7431427240371704, 0.7330358028411865, 0.7269746661186218, 0.7155903577804565, 0.7101839780807495, 0.697563648223877, 0.6827436685562134, 0.6791789531707764, 0.6709922552108765, 0.6699753999710083, 0.6674296855926514, 0.6669262647628784, 0.6574873328208923, 0.6556916236877441, 0.6525379419326782, 0.6476446986198425, 0.6438356041908264, 0.6349743604660034, 0.6297403573989868, 0.627202033996582, 0.6255308985710144, 0.623733401298523, 0.6186598539352417, 0.6124951243400574, 0.6120778322219849, 0.6083745360374451, 0.606957197189331, 0.6060358881950378, 0.6016626358032227, 0.596752405166626, 0.5895581841468811, 0.583831787109375, 0.5811751484870911, 0.577380359172821, 0.5770528316497803, 0.5725961923599243, 0.5588077306747437, 0.552811861038208, 0.5513439178466797, 0.5509507656097412, 0.5490562915802002, 0.5469293594360352, 0.5460394024848938, 0.5398774147033691, 0.5376136898994446, 0.5363506078720093, 0.5343986749649048, 0.5324962735176086, 0.5322431921958923, 0.5319945812225342, 0.5308105945587158, 0.5246756076812744, 0.5227679014205933, 0.5110088586807251, 0.5040987133979797, 0.5038723945617676, 0.4943687617778778, 0.41982361674308777","5.839956903183418, 5.316085688364151, 4.056312785223991, 5.323593724579936, 8.84728369677509, 5.323593724579936, 0.8225681852235452, 0.8002905260677651, 6.56310753864917, 3.0318236889412318, 5.719432063059522, 5.372396085100232, 8.276664995857729, 10.94083957610436, 5.785864638808331, 7.722425220274044, 7.074741683788238, 3.9067913584311227, 7.89286276509362, 3.7445695170604143, 6.668615676050068, 11.045693658610517, 10.62873299890754, 10.724709280351934, 5.634019449919454, 8.874222894197892, 10.163653941327404, 9.768141289765099, 3.2104800738451416, 4.725676278593779, 4.926932385901191, 9.882795869486806, 1.1681410382863517, 9.503394844978352, 2.3890216002436206, 5.176132109360826, 5.976284406187974, 10.186861699516477, 10.248727018862999, 8.579958540579113, 9.144665259922967, 8.851252096309114, 10.358884873743756, 8.709553798569289, 8.28690626858478, 7.006005563269268, 9.414700748450725, 6.296064014016388, 7.219534089417906, 9.910191680522306, 0.0, 10.145697322633554, 11.065803822411187, 12.735188492506767, 9.213115686005736, 9.16518651465612, 9.309707493901412, 4.349103604109452, 10.896314662504794, 6.550903961364462","[2] N.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [29] N.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E. Johnson, N. F. Olson. Accelerated ripening of Gouda cheese. II.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [31] N.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [13] Z.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.8111971020698547, 0.7879002094268799, 0.7810644507408142, 0.7653318643569946, 0.7652091979980469, 0.7643663883209229, 0.73531174659729, 0.6997312307357788, 0.6729245185852051, 0.6668845415115356, 0.6653642654418945, 0.6650370359420776, 0.6649327874183655, 0.6515780687332153, 0.6495657563209534, 0.6416889429092407, 0.6356887817382812, 0.6343294382095337, 0.6317524313926697, 0.6315220594406128, 0.6296989321708679, 0.626910924911499, 0.6248860359191895, 0.6209234595298767, 0.6195143461227417, 0.6186050176620483, 0.6142776012420654, 0.6142197847366333, 0.6110587120056152, 0.6002652645111084, 0.5919075012207031, 0.5839834213256836, 0.5796300172805786, 0.5774185657501221, 0.5749422311782837, 0.5690524578094482, 0.5647732019424438, 0.5581588745117188, 0.5513507127761841, 0.5498643517494202, 0.5495723485946655, 0.5476132035255432, 0.5475671291351318, 0.5454219579696655, 0.544042706489563, 0.5437690615653992, 0.5413624048233032, 0.539916455745697, 0.5295735597610474, 0.5291013717651367, 0.5271762609481812, 0.5259671211242676, 0.5207158923149109, 0.5206416845321655, 0.5188013315200806, 0.5103452205657959, 0.487641841173172, 0.48696285486221313, 0.46375590562820435, 0.4256417453289032","12.176757787780748, 11.4939230792146, 6.552966156908562, 10.393113669821322, 12.156682947298616, 11.4939230792146, 4.2130989214135575, 12.092925104468998, 9.028017085756995, 11.735240997463459, 2.859793854938806, 6.799053491074081, 13.491598242206681, 7.61753764578205, 9.380693900655682, 6.829539252190166, 9.065920570031711, 10.814050303645336, 5.929769076503737, 13.108685450781046, 6.282884728554707, 12.63545744528106, 5.665351154826254, 9.226397391759114, 13.887032607378302, 9.361174202598262, 12.561713738349509, 10.913373913108428, 12.563807771210014, 5.461237051356584, 4.725676278593774, 1.6523391835426924, 5.651892569111856, 3.915222625784239, 11.293713577728655, 10.816738471664289, 4.504745539040009, 11.418652484772064, 12.219925959331112, 11.903880710270819, 12.799298776966264, 12.276386920251493, 10.735381707901656, 11.857318205278432, 7.919032534425202, 8.866551750011356, 11.900291365373095, 6.2960640140163795, 10.23517521827547, 11.873803927259743, 11.757336522962262, 11.745048109377777, 14.509412631900542, 11.264075816177849, 10.781310468921243, 0.0, 12.315295770534467, 11.17846695773931, 6.133474403380948, 6.550903961364456","[3] S.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [23] M. E. Aly. Utilization of freeze-shocked lactobacilli for enhancing flavour development of Ras cheese.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [29] N.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [34] A.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.7921459674835205, 0.7211973667144775, 0.7177150249481201, 0.7120105624198914, 0.6901572942733765, 0.6874862909317017, 0.6797890067100525, 0.6774510145187378, 0.6659774780273438, 0.6550990343093872, 0.6485570669174194, 0.647127091884613, 0.6425060033798218, 0.6257598400115967, 0.6248420476913452, 0.6238338947296143, 0.622538685798645, 0.6212010979652405, 0.6208339929580688, 0.616539478302002, 0.5992634892463684, 0.5945101976394653, 0.5934395790100098, 0.5878167152404785, 0.5874371528625488, 0.5833500623703003, 0.582618236541748, 0.5802326202392578, 0.5785223245620728, 0.5726692080497742, 0.572632908821106, 0.5705456137657166, 0.5613517761230469, 0.5603207349777222, 0.5567100048065186, 0.5563589334487915, 0.5554473400115967, 0.5529322624206543, 0.55268394947052, 0.550079882144928, 0.5340030789375305, 0.5333467125892639, 0.5327332019805908, 0.5322639346122742, 0.5317933559417725, 0.5284739136695862, 0.5279726386070251, 0.5180286169052124, 0.5105726718902588, 0.5099070072174072, 0.5019899010658264, 0.5013715624809265, 0.5008300542831421, 0.49877768754959106, 0.49462026357650757, 0.49328553676605225, 0.47631266713142395, 0.4714735448360443, 0.470326691865921, 0.41498157382011414","24.940402023777366, 9.435947928833695, 6.552966156908562, 7.652303810874269, 6.475779654885985, 12.190096951493585, 17.070759691421944, 1.2592128028032759, 4.550582678186987, 12.394081334676102, 13.057784420262541, 5.372396085100227, 8.894733092949227, 13.199943376493447, 6.282884728554707, 4.172580227195301, 4.4532793738556204, 5.822953878755702, 4.558185872298774, 2.0345698639491596, 4.3575745774473305, 10.242195001603699, 4.9669313613222315, 8.044352705511853, 1.6523391835426924, 5.70352446892183, 14.329232604795596, 11.336970843447782, 5.651892569111856, 8.887198980953505, 4.116591400881561, 12.143366793108259, 11.757336522962262, 6.4153863145828005, 11.048225120319685, 8.503409369551214, 0.0, 9.381583426295721, 3.9152226257842386, 8.379752386615683, 10.23517521827547, 12.356654581708131, 15.380219416012656, 12.219925959331112, 4.504745539040009, 11.963411442519511, 14.571063228923212, 11.167720238771263, 9.855872033801045, 6.133474403380948, 13.125083166266482, 8.136241872994905, 6.2960640140163795, 13.111188452749008, 12.37300261599525, 7.919032534425202, 11.17846695773931, 9.980991794668215, 9.715637011149902, 5.15649348135621","[4] S.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [34] A.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid. New type of Domiati cheese of potential benefit to people with high blood cholesterol, Journal of Dairy Research, Vol. 59, 89-94, 1992. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [37] P.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [27] H.

LWT Food Science and Technology,Vol. 25, 438-441, 1992. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [17] M. H.Abd-El-Salam, S. El-Shibiny, H. A. El-Alamy.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [1] J.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [35] T.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [38] T.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [17] M. H.Abd-El-Salam, S. El-Shibiny, H. A. El-Alamy.

Studies on some bacteriological and chemical properties of Kariesh cheese. MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [18] M.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M. El-Soda. Characteristics of Ras cheese made with freeze-shocked Pediococcushalophilus.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus.

Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin. Survival and therapeutic potential of probiotic organisms with reference to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. Immunology Cell Biology,Vol. 78, 80-88, 2000. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [13] Z. H. Iskandar. Annales du Service des Antiques de Egypt. IskandarPublisher, Cairo, Egypt, 1942. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.8454136848449707, 0.8019649982452393, 0.8017858862876892, 0.7998623251914978, 0.7875885963439941, 0.740179181098938, 0.7193334102630615, 0.67641282081604, 0.6597424745559692, 0.6575055122375488, 0.6481439471244812, 0.6402932405471802, 0.6344541311264038, 0.6283968687057495, 0.6260040402412415, 0.6183961629867554, 0.6170884370803833, 0.6170392632484436, 0.6142381429672241, 0.6139729022979736, 0.6081878542900085, 0.6060348749160767, 0.6040034890174866, 0.5950509309768677, 0.5930359363555908, 0.5894070267677307, 0.5889512300491333, 0.5817989110946655, 0.5808045268058777, 0.5805966854095459, 0.5794286727905273, 0.5767948627471924, 0.5707100033760071, 0.5692969560623169, 0.568732500076294, 0.5679289102554321, 0.559372067451477, 0.5582929849624634, 0.5571075677871704, 0.5493117570877075, 0.5478999614715576, 0.5424944758415222, 0.540850818157196, 0.5304021239280701, 0.5303696393966675, 0.530115008354187, 0.5195103883743286, 0.5133960843086243, 0.5123403072357178, 0.5107988715171814, 0.5059612393379211, 0.5008776187896729, 0.4969403147697449, 0.4950476288795471, 0.4814889430999756, 0.47478342056274414, 0.4730711579322815, 0.46911075711250305, 0.46801522374153137, 0.46648579835891724","5.726605982004308, 5.580084062799792, 32.612417989909574, 5.2072003802397475, 3.6600338375043986, 5.2072003802397475, 3.3905307361900117, 2.915430344601047, 2.3675285101455987, 6.333227067506018, 7.898575316074674, 4.71042302880139, 10.832426629239771, 4.091071804171061, 4.688659458936298, 11.170176735851609, 5.49057974859983, 7.6880717597008115, 2.059503328871041, 5.224047970512784, 3.4304360645151575, 6.301520269232042, 3.1015581483562125, 3.7445695170604103, 1.6523391835426924, 10.129498786859134, 10.516270066884555, 5.274659196741765, 1.5603470544514573, 3.6546670972714734, 7.178653597205295, 7.292842479594212, 10.747593197241288, 3.777638408409827, 10.843680019973684, 3.1753842877380336, 7.534881965891697, 1.7024019756911837, 8.6054552410907, 9.212855952243931, 11.941191308607038, 2.7207118256624296, 8.253930491317226, 8.928270372989465, 11.545833905577654, 2.8995055021174396, 10.069048308969982, 12.621294914807368, 2.6470249941572273, 7.725100129525627, 10.048162663162897, 5.869489857102574, 10.838671773229938, 0.0, 8.864002013164702, 9.749542791757886, 13.174625187497469, 4.851108000961974, 7.664060016442687, 3.8622280161613376","[8] S.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S. A.Awad, B.Gehan, J.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science,Vol. 1, 141-147, 1973. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [32] C.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [28] F.

Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [19] M. Korish, A. M. AbdElhamid.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [23] M.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [30] O.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [22] N. H. Ahmed, M.A. El-Soda, A. N. Hassan, Frank J.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.8453549146652222, 0.8153032064437866, 0.7465486526489258, 0.7203976511955261, 0.7030122876167297, 0.6751939058303833, 0.6654702425003052, 0.6652198433876038, 0.6642094850540161, 0.6457129716873169, 0.6453877687454224, 0.6449102163314819, 0.6306492686271667, 0.6260562539100647, 0.6253066062927246, 0.6205626130104065, 0.6165338158607483, 0.6153778433799744, 0.6145460605621338, 0.6124756932258606, 0.6118377447128296, 0.6099398136138916, 0.6070240139961243, 0.6010400652885437, 0.596394419670105, 0.5912415981292725, 0.5854251980781555, 0.5819346904754639, 0.5776183605194092, 0.5748722553253174, 0.5684625506401062, 0.567950427532196, 0.5672116875648499, 0.5661213397979736, 0.5653908252716064, 0.5567514896392822, 0.5528613328933716, 0.55269455909729, 0.5475115180015564, 0.5469740629196167, 0.5456146001815796, 0.5335222482681274, 0.5327268838882446, 0.5259265899658203, 0.5252102017402649, 0.5250552296638489, 0.5208278298377991, 0.5203520059585571, 0.5174722671508789, 0.5139331817626953, 0.5082011818885803, 0.5053209066390991, 0.5047408938407898, 0.49806198477745056, 0.48776572942733765, 0.4756618142127991, 0.4682076573371887, 0.4553929567337036, 0.4517848491668701, 0.4395199120044708","41.80855609335097, 28.09106266977045, 10.142657735005555, 9.405226265794303, 17.830808500489095, 7.907464012541069, 7.624104832898398, 4.13751978094686, 9.405226265794303, 2.518425605606557, 11.984185810951972, 12.936883340387595, 9.217928389403223, 2.588530930389749, 2.760248287756349, 4.970839339482483, 11.535404681319047, 8.225756759199841, 1.5603470544514608, 13.044260668171642, 5.139442677952521, 16.742515922307195, 6.661835836271127, 1.702401975691188, 8.711345120700965, 11.181920286136096, 5.699096312599456, 2.1712645344061965, 4.246912851203061, 0.0, 9.936714316950304, 3.839364577352531, 12.375119548806568, 9.381583426295734, 1.8520839313163626, 4.800130218697371, 6.097085771396334, 11.621385650374892, 9.289506170041777, 6.415386314582809, 3.0029031164272344, 4.193770967312321, 10.466749006577121, 8.01378779982866, 12.694806948394934, 10.455997857244158, 13.158814090106645, 10.601732221550733, 8.057589163924854, 12.18362079030429, 9.323736693197862, 9.970507677348092, 5.036851211213114, 12.397748622141442, 8.17582353104567, 12.356982400102217, 11.303198242050412, 10.224504649662574, 10.626956591098615, 6.587842248074052","[11] S.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

It was developed in the | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | [30] O.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20].","0.7665514945983887, 0.5059751272201538, 0.48934662342071533, 0.48875707387924194, 0.4873051047325134, 0.4800136387348175, 0.4725586175918579, 0.47207438945770264, 0.4673360288143158, 0.4518883228302002, 0.4492001533508301, 0.44713646173477173, 0.44667577743530273, 0.43769386410713196, 0.4371127784252167, 0.4363509714603424, 0.4360656142234802, 0.43369704484939575, 0.4301398992538452, 0.42927566170692444, 0.4255853593349457, 0.4184049963951111, 0.4177744388580322, 0.41333967447280884, 0.41072067618370056, 0.4041222333908081, 0.4034194350242615, 0.40288838744163513, 0.4024757444858551, 0.402153879404068, 0.40088987350463867, 0.3960418105125427, 0.3906208872795105, 0.38709014654159546, 0.38555899262428284, 0.37601861357688904, 0.3754858374595642, 0.37520334124565125, 0.37510648369789124, 0.36523979902267456, 0.3617386817932129, 0.34736552834510803, 0.3432372212409973, 0.3390592336654663, 0.33876413106918335, 0.336877703666687, 0.3359648585319519, 0.32350924611091614, 0.32252413034439087, 0.3198953866958618, 0.31978639960289, 0.31949514150619507, 0.3156692385673523, 0.30585554242134094, 0.30396324396133423, 0.3008681535720825, 0.29769641160964966, 0.2894653081893921, 0.28387483954429626, 0.2797584533691406","7.004823243988292, 0.0, 1.560347054451459, 0.0, 1.2153264652846396, 1.5430851637400806, 1.2479467329259863, 3.8120524164491947, 1.560347054451459, 0.0, 1.2479467329259863, 2.892932319404164, 3.973681614103317, 4.937968924998698, 5.357833424274392, 3.7764371491522546, 1.69550407465516, 3.886577897053056, 2.1712645344061947, 3.4937723272534242, 1.60524003692257, 1.1945108001218097, 3.0232743029025917, 5.634715791566737, 4.255537162005056, 7.056051968299039, 1.784667839601399, 2.9579016004539227, 7.006571385396915, 9.48121733156952, 1.6818746206788324, 4.1936907624156925, 3.5745590409941324, 3.6144302037909144, 4.869477179498373, 6.661755397783586, 6.13384714192634, 3.777638408409831, 3.0667372016904757, 4.867491145242863, 8.870630098837708, 5.877815990992632, 5.427964264626796, 6.341916422244216, 7.655912307902658, 6.437178285633852, 6.184417296455059, 7.193000631166598, 5.265247120490557, 6.649785693875437, 6.45752741633805, 5.9504839679664805, 6.641541658475878, 4.140538949467791, 7.521477245641157, 5.256638496169588, 5.907090833156135, 5.557801841875652, 4.954357780007047, 6.359449771847108","[13] Z.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [2] N.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [30] O. M. Salem, A. I. Hamed, K. M. K. Kebary, A. S. El-Sisi.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [34] A. E. Abou-Dawood,S. M. Abdou.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture.

Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [13] Z.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

International Journal of Dairy Technology,Vol. 65, 237-242, 2012 | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [32] C.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [8] S. A. Abou-Donia.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M. El-Soda.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W. M.Bakr,N. F. Gomaa. Bacteriological Quality of Some Dairy Products (Kariesh Cheese and Ice Cream). Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese).

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 27, 359-368, 1999a | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [9] S.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [6] S. A. Abou-Donia. A Colour Guide to Cheese and Fermented Milks.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [8] S.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [28] F. A. Exterkate, G. J. C. M.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [23] M.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [30] O. M. Salem, A. I. Hamed, K. M. K. Kebary, A. S. El-Sisi.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [16] Y.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [7] S.A. Abou-Donia.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [26] H.

Milchwissenschaft, Vol. 42, 139-144, 1987. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [28] F. A. Exterkate, G. J. C. M.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [38] T.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [1] J.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [29] N. Ezzat, H. El-Shafei. Accelerated ripening of Ras cheese using freeze and heat-shocked.

Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Egyptian Domiati soft white cheese. New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 21, 167-190, 1986. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [24] Y. Ardo, H. L. Mansson.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M. El-Soda. Characteristics of Ras cheese made with freeze-shocked Pediococcushalophilus.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17].","0.664577305316925, 0.6555524468421936, 0.6506931781768799, 0.6442393660545349, 0.6394824981689453, 0.6390722990036011, 0.6286002397537231, 0.6272005438804626, 0.6242109537124634, 0.6194407939910889, 0.6117644309997559, 0.6096809506416321, 0.6080083847045898, 0.6059578061103821, 0.6057698726654053, 0.6028689742088318, 0.6004669070243835, 0.5987112522125244, 0.5964006185531616, 0.5950716733932495, 0.5909358263015747, 0.5908976793289185, 0.5888625979423523, 0.5871639251708984, 0.584937572479248, 0.5849294066429138, 0.5847756862640381, 0.5847189426422119, 0.583789587020874, 0.5836136341094971, 0.5820299983024597, 0.5813507437705994, 0.5787814855575562, 0.5726485252380371, 0.5701464414596558, 0.5656127333641052, 0.5568801164627075, 0.5430819392204285, 0.542109489440918, 0.5419907569885254, 0.5418983101844788, 0.5403894186019897, 0.5403686165809631, 0.5402419567108154, 0.5392163991928101, 0.5390170812606812, 0.5307745337486267, 0.5281914472579956, 0.5278847217559814, 0.5265023112297058, 0.521016001701355, 0.5175361633300781, 0.5162160396575928, 0.5138895511627197, 0.5107947587966919, 0.507676362991333, 0.4897793233394623, 0.4720475673675537, 0.4645581841468811, 0.449348509311676","18.979927926110808, 8.500063530215803, 9.449210652755772, 6.5529661569085595, 8.225710897047932, 5.5993979489640635, 7.383042066923489, 4.725676278593772, 10.088426281627335, 6.5715404575059155, 11.187552367742784, 2.05950332887104, 11.976391611355615, 13.578683078581093, 6.805882701831605, 5.143671826975531, 13.454973655935941, 6.282884728554704, 13.232494097695307, 3.9152226257842364, 11.520058054669349, 11.785915167327017, 7.477955236431768, 12.123264176508714, 4.918965691010776, 5.9617235959143775, 10.222306641042332, 5.651892569111854, 15.344641488512323, 8.76843822434412, 10.235175218275465, 6.5715404575059155, 12.08723660242801, 1.6523391835426924, 4.504745539040005, 2.116833650418416, 8.218428456418483, 6.070369972386982, 11.126918914316466, 13.754246614504108, 13.779176970863654, 12.459860534720322, 6.296064014016375, 11.44334040405455, 17.447932767168407, 10.177976947294303, 10.965042606874501, 11.108892746821581, 9.904931109633056, 12.697613024361209, 7.208881501215414, 10.590503459622877, 6.133474403380944, 10.03132612526728, 10.592699185876528, 11.919230711571098, 10.949242941114639, 0.0, 10.598643432164192, 5.277206875592859","[19] M.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [4] S.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [36] K.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [38] T.

The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [22] N.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [1] J. A. Phelan, J. Renaud, P. F. Fox. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology, Chapman & Hall Publishers, London, 1993. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E. Johnson, N. F.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [25] R.

Foodborne Pathology DiseaseVol. 7, 411-418, 2010. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [32] C.

Champan& Hall Publishers, London, 1995. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M. El-Soda. Characteristics of Ras cheese made with freeze-shocked Pediococcushalophilus. LWT Food Science and Technology,Vol. 25, 438-441, 1992. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | [14] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian Domiati soft white cheese.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [18] M. M. Omar, A. I. El-Zayat. A study on the ripening of white pickled Brinza cheese made from ewe's milk.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [24] Y.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [30] O.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [17] M.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [26] H.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [27] H.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S. A.Awad, B.Gehan, J.

Journal of Applied Microbiology Vol. 103, 427-435, 2007. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | [27] H. El-Shafei, A.

The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [13] Z. H. Iskandar. Annales du Service des Antiques de Egypt. IskandarPublisher, Cairo, Egypt, 1942. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful","0.7476150393486023, 0.7355287075042725, 0.7310744524002075, 0.7289993762969971, 0.7181104421615601, 0.7162752151489258, 0.6949445009231567, 0.6912347078323364, 0.6899963021278381, 0.6753876209259033, 0.6739968061447144, 0.67333984375, 0.6710802316665649, 0.6675988435745239, 0.6581301689147949, 0.6577668190002441, 0.6448384523391724, 0.6407521367073059, 0.6386408805847168, 0.638219952583313, 0.6307998895645142, 0.6239268779754639, 0.6237953901290894, 0.6222982406616211, 0.6206153035163879, 0.614955723285675, 0.6053745746612549, 0.6022334098815918, 0.5991281270980835, 0.5953507423400879, 0.5915549993515015, 0.5851755142211914, 0.581468939781189, 0.5803613662719727, 0.5745683908462524, 0.5736516714096069, 0.5722583532333374, 0.5713428258895874, 0.5700928568840027, 0.5673879384994507, 0.5663797855377197, 0.563133716583252, 0.5576267838478088, 0.5529564023017883, 0.5506796836853027, 0.5495820045471191, 0.5442959070205688, 0.5402817726135254, 0.5392547249794006, 0.5385805368423462, 0.5315090417861938, 0.5287454724311829, 0.5264376401901245, 0.5263135433197021, 0.522390604019165, 0.5208353996276855, 0.5040603280067444, 0.5033025145530701, 0.5022116899490356, 0.47602981328964233","7.943382207590244, 6.17889200287268, 6.962479861875561, 8.564887200584064, 7.011930454457125, 8.121663181000216, 7.4784539057530885, 5.561116775438166, 9.42890423818862, 9.763221920126496, 10.152325927000783, 8.121663181000216, 9.90744940367048, 11.109391920230465, 4.18958188937482, 0.0, 9.687660727630512, 3.1206941089029234, 0.0, 9.256082972964839, 13.535962592275204, 2.9981840532449398, 7.856111767806241, 6.284952380829353, 7.903933832653857, 9.948596048775778, 7.127676160376743, 5.739582698760517, 3.4048039513823776, 5.311200692583811, 5.882168235359653, 9.084629396014398, 8.245023976688255, 7.9280125836687905, 7.13980066633156, 1.6523391835426924, 5.651892569111864, 10.045580711762879, 7.744938539569974, 2.3890216002436233, 11.486261084961566, 8.563785893749495, 7.431075828902083, 6.624891823255065, 8.584640329501855, 5.730933227602954, 3.2104800738451456, 8.296797625254792, 8.93056759424286, 5.728159740303993, 8.523047765657138, 9.30530876761043, 0.0, 5.036851211213117, 8.586245257817769, 6.670599390026211, 8.651335195317813, 6.69257393685149, 4.577902399520262, 3.568741598543009","[23] M.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [4] S.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [2] N.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [35] T.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | [13] Z.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [31] N.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [7] S.A.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 19, 7-18, 1984. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [8] S. A. Abou-Donia. Importance of Fermented Milks and Related Cheese, Egyptian Diet. Proceedings of the Alexandria Symposium on Starter Cultures and their Use in Dairy Industry, Alexandria, 108-114, 1999b. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | [2] N.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin. Survival and therapeutic potential of probiotic organisms with reference to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. Immunology Cell Biology,Vol. 78, 80-88, 2000. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Recently, studies | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | [13] Z. H. Iskandar.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [24] Y.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [6] S. A. Abou-Donia.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [38] T.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley. Stability of Lactobacillus reuteri in different types of microcapsules. Journal of Food Science,Vol. 71, 20-24, 2006. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [6] S.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | [21] O. H. Baraheem, H. A. El-Shamy, W.

Alexandria, Vol. 82 No. 5, 2007. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | probiotic could provide the recommended number in the final product. Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus. Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [30] O.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [24] Y.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [9] S.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature.

Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [8] S.

Geographical distribution and historical development of ancient Egyptian dairy products, 7th Egyptian Conference for Dairy Science and Technology, 23, 1998. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [9] S.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | [4] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian fresh fermented milk products. New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 19, 7-18, 1984. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [21] O.

Cayenne and green pepper extracts showed the highest activity followed by dill and parsley against S. aureus.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature.

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [36] K. Kailasapathy, J. Chin.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [35] T. M. El-Nemr, S. A.Awad, B.Gehan, J.

Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [1] J.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [29] N.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science,Vol. 19, 347-358, 1991. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Recently, studies | [18] M. M. Omar, A. I. El-Zayat. A study on the ripening of white pickled Brinza cheese made from ewe's milk. Molecular Nutrition Food Research, Vol. 31, 783-791, 1987 | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | [32] C.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [3] S.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [8] S.

It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [11] S. A. Abou-Donia.

It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [37] P. Muthukumarasamy, P. W. Allan,A. R. Holley.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [19] M.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [26] H. J.Barteles, M. E. Johnson, N. F. Olson.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | [3] S.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [24] Y. Ardo, H. L. Mansson.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [6] S. A. Abou-Donia.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | [11] S. A. Abou-Donia. Geographical distribution and historical development of ancient Egyptian dairy products, 7th Egyptian Conference for Dairy Science and Technology, 23, 1998. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [11] S. A. Abou-Donia.

For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Twelve different concentrations of ethanol extract from the plants were prepared for determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [24] Y.

Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [3] S. A. Abou-Donia, M. A. El-Soda.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used. Hydrocolloids (commercial pectin, citrus pectin or carboxymethylcellulose) addition to positive effect on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Recently, studies | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [9] S. M. El-Gendy. Fermented Foods of Egypt and the Middle East.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [6] S.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [25] R. M. Badawi, M. K.Kebary.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [26] H.

In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Recently, studies | The Egyptian standards for Kariesh cheese No.1008/2000 mentioned no account on the acceptable level of total bacterial count, but they obligate the pasteurization or any equivalent heat treatment of the cheese milk with the addition of powerful starter culture. It indicates that the total coliforms are less than 10 CFU/g; E. coli absent in 1 g, S. aureus (coagulate-positive) absent in 1 g, L. monocytogenes absent in 1 g, Salmonella and other pathogens absent in 25 g, yeasts and molds less than 10 CFU/g. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [32] C.

Addition of cayenne or green pepper to Kariesh cheese during manufacture revealed that both spices were able to reduce the S. aureus population, to an undetectable level within the first and second days of storage. A lot of study, about the effect of combining plant materials. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [38] T. Heidebach, P. FÃ¶rst, U. Kulozik. Microencapsulation of probiotic cells by means of rennet-gelation of milk proteins. Food Hydrocolloids,Vol. 23, 1670-1677, 2009 | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | [27] H. El-Shafei, A. Hantira, N. Ezzat, M. El-Soda.

Moreover, it can be assessed that the use of milk-proteins in microencapsulation of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 could increase the acetic and lactic acids during storage [19]. | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [13] Z. H. Iskandar. Annales du Service des Antiques de Egypt. IskandarPublisher, Cairo, Egypt, 1942. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [25] R.

Journal of Applied Microbiology Vol. 103, 427-435, 2007. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | [14] S. A. Abou-Donia. Egyptian Domiati soft white cheese.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | [15] S. A. Abou-Donia.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [4] S.

New Zealand Journal of Dairy Science and Technology, Vol. 19, 7-18, 1984. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough.

Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | [8] S.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | [27] H.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | [34] A.

After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

Survival and therapeutic potential of probiotic organisms with reference to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. Immunology Cell Biology,Vol. 78, 80-88, 2000. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process.

Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage.

MSc Thesis, University of Ain Shams, Cairo, 1967. | Abstract Kariesh is a soft acid cheese made from skimmed cow's milk, buffalo milk or buttermilk from sour cream; apparently it is made only on farmsteads. It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [2] N.

Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science,Vol. 1, 141-147, 1973. | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C). In order to eliminate microbes that cause disease or defects and the corruption of the product, it is recommended that the addition of the first active lactic acid bacteria from a rate of 3-5% of the weight of milk following Leaving the ba | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [15] S.

The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy.

One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation.

Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat Kariesh cheese, the total bacterial count, coliform count, and yeast and moulds counts, were determined. It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | ed to prepare water-insoluble microcapsules based on milk-proteins without significant loss of cell during the encapsulation process. For in-vitro trial, it was carried out that Microencapsulation protected the cells during incubation under simulated gastric conditions at low pH [38]. Preparing functional Kariesh cheese with encapsulated Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15704, made with rennet-gelled of milk proteins, is done to evaluate the survival of encapsulated cultures under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and to determine any possible change of encapsulated Bifidobacterium and organic acids in Kariesh cheese during the storage period. Microencapsulation in protein milk micro particles successfully improved the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in bile solutions, and protected the B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the microencapsulation significantly increased the survival of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in Kariesh cheese during cold storage. The numbers of B. adolescentis ATCC 15704 in encapsulated state were 8.12 log CFU/g at the end of two weeks of cold storage. This viable cell number was higher than that recommended by the International Dairy Federation (107 CFU/g), indicating that the high initial number of | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21].

Recently, studies | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | [28] F.

Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Attenuated bacteria have been used instead of live bacteria to decrease the acid production. It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | Increasing demand has lead to the commercial production of Kariesh cheese which, under such conditions, is frequently made from pasteurized and/or homogenized milk or reconstituted milk, using Lactobacillus bulgaricus as the starter and usually with rennet (3 ml/100 kg) rather than acid as coagulant. Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C).

It was developed in the | sin without movement while maintaining the temperature of the milk inside for the length of this process with excellent coverage to prevent atmosphere contamination. After fully solidifying, which may take 5-7 hours; the cheese is transferred from the clot to the mat and covered with gauze. During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method.

After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | [2] N. A. Abou-Zeid.

Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | Attenuated lactic acid bacteria either heat-shocked or freeze-shocked have been used to accelerate the ripening of many cheese varieties [23-29]. | [13] Z.

Journal of Food Science,Vol. 71, 20-24, 2006. | Several approaches have been proposed to improve therapeutic effect of Kariesh cheese. One of the most common approaches is to modify the manufacturing procedure in order to increase the Bifidobacterium [35]. The main therapeutic benefits of Bifidobacterium are: immune enhancement, prevention of diarrhoea disease and colon cancer, enhancement of immunity against intestinal infections, prevention of upper gastrointestinal tract diseases and hypercholesterolemia; improvement in lactose utilization; and stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier [36]. The number of viable Bifidobacterium taken orally is decreased due to action of processing and storage conditions of the food containing them and to the action of gastric juice and bile salts. Bifidobacterium has poor survivability in dairy products as they do not tolerate exposure to highly acidic and aerated media [37]. During in-vivo trial, microencapsulation techniques have been investigated to improve the viability of lactic acid bacteria when incorporated in dairy products. In this in-vivo process cells are retained within an encapsulating matrix or membrane. The most widely used encapsulating material is alginate, through a direct compression encapsulation, and rennet-gelled protein encapsulation. Rennet could be us | [23] M. E. Aly.

It succeeded to improve the Kariesh cheese quality in the first part of this study by adding sodium citrate and attenuated lactococci, especially freeze shocked Lactococcus diacetylactis [30]. Addition of attenuated Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus caused a significant (p<0.05) increase of soluble nitrogen, soluble tyrosine and soluble tryptophan, while it decreased the TVFA and scores of Kariesh cheese. Cheeses made with L. bulgaricus had higher proteolysis indices and lower TVFA than those of cheese made with S. thermophilus. Combinations of Lactococcus diacetylactis and S. thermophilus or L. bulgaricus increased cheese acceptability. Kariesh cheese made with combinations of L. diacetylactis and S. thermophilus either heat or freeze-shocked was the most acceptable cheese. The pickling period could be shortened by 33% without any effect on cheese acceptability or quality as well as shortening the manufacture time to minimize the possibility of contamination [30]. | [32] C.

It is considered to be one of the most important traditional Egyptian dairy products, commonly made in the Egyptian countryside, especially in small villages, as low-income people such as farmers use Kariesh cheese in their diet owing to its high protein content, low fat and price. Therefore, nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. The aim of this article is to provide a wide range of information on Egyptian Kariesh cheese starting with a brief description of its historical background, origin and manufacturing process, within both traditional and modern production methods. Also, this study shall outline Kariesh's chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation in order to evaluate protein, fat and carbohydrates content considering consumer health and acceptance. Consequently, this review will highlight recent innovations in dealing with Kariesh cheese flavour enhancement using lactic acid bacteria; textural properties improved by the addition of hydrocolloid and using some natural antimicrobial effects of pepper, parsley and dill which subject to reach top adequate cheese quality and quantity that meet customer satisfaction in contemporary modern markets. | [17] M.

It has been found that addition of plant materials to Kariesh cheese reduced the total bacterial and coliform populations. All concentrations of cayenne, green pepper, dill, and parsley (9%) completely reduced the yeast count within 2 hours. Cayenne and green pepper entirely reduced the mold count within 2 days, whereas parsley and dill were found to be less effective. Kariesh cheese prepared with 1% cayenne pepper and 3% and 6% each of green pepper, dill, and parsley were found strongly acceptable to the consumer and considered the most preferable type. Therefore, this study revealed that pepper, parsley, and dill exhibited antibacterial activity against natural microflora, coliforms, yeast and molds, and S. aureus in Kariesh cheese, and the addition of these plants is acceptable to the consumer and may contribute to the development of new and safe varieties of Kariesh cheese [31]. | [11] S.

Another technique is also used; coagulation of the blend of milk/buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours; a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed, and this long, cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size [1]. In large scale factories, Kariesh Cheese is manufactured from partially or whole skimmed milk. The percentage of fats cannot be more than 0.1-0.5%, depending on the quality of the separator and provide favourable conditions not to leak any percentage of milk fat in the sorting. Kariesh cheese manufacturing in large scale production, is made by filtration of fresh milk, pasteurization at temperature 75 Â°C for 15 seconds and then cooling to the point (37-40 Â°C).

During the packaging template, the Kariesh is slated to a rate of 5-7% depending on the consumer request, and then it's well covered with gauze. Moreover, after four hours it gets sealed with a wooden cover; then after another hour, Kariesh is added an amount of weight gradually increasing (in order to regulate the disposal of whey) until the rate is up to one third the weight of the clot. If moisture is still high after 24 to 36 hours of weight and some test clot remains, more gravity is placed again for several hours. At optimum moisture content, the Kariesh is cut into cubes, weighed to calculate the dressing and packaged in containers suitable for fresh consumption. Usually this process takes a long time in the industry scale whoever it can be reduced by using one of two ways: increase the amount of starter used to 10% instead of 5%, and this gives to the cheese acidity somehow high for the previous method. After the addition of starter (3-5%) on the appropriate degree of activity by about half an hour to an hour, is added very few standard rennet about 2-5 cm per 100 kg. Recently, the process of ultrafiltration has been used for | [6] S. A. Abou-Donia. A Colour Guide to Cheese and Fermented Milks. Champan& Hall Publishers, London, 1995. | Various factors affect the chemical composition and microstructure of Kariesh cheese like: type and pre-treatment of the milk, season of milk production, micro flora of the cheese, starter addition, type of coagulant used, additives in the cheese milk, storage time and temperature. The composition of Kariesh cheese is 16.70% protein, 3.98% sugar and 0.1% fat [19]. | Kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., it's made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk or a mixture of both, also it can be produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant.Recently, the increasing demand by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its high protein content and low price. The production of Kariesh cheese by addition of hydrocolloids had a profound influence on its chemical composition, yield, rheological and sensory characteristics. Addition of hydrocolloids increased cheese moisture content and decreased hardness, protein, salt and ash content. It is recommended to use and implement immediate regulatory measures like good manufacturing practices as well as distribution and retail storage practices for ensuring microbiological safety of kariesh cheese. Kariesh cheese is one of the best non-meat sources of protein, full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time, so it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Nowadays, Kariesh cheese is a promising food in the avoidance of health problems associated with fat, particularly for old people. | Protein, salt and ash content, decreased with increasing hydrocolloids levels. Rheological characteristics (hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience) were significantly lower in cheeses made with hydrocolloids than cheese made without hydrocolloids. Kariesh cheese made with 0.4% w/w commercial pectin and 0.6% w/w carboxymethyl cellulose, recorded the highest scores for sensory attributes [19]. The overall quality evaluation showed that it was possible to produce high desired soft and easy melt Kariesh, using citrus pectin or carboxymethyl cellulose. Increasing of Kariesh cheese yield may be occurred by water holding of pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose. Therefore, it is recommended to use 0.4% commercial pectin or 0.6% carboxymethyl cellulose to improve textural properties of low-fat soft (Kariesh) cheese. | indicate that the art of the primitive dairy industry to produce Laban Reyeb, Laban Khad, Laban Zeer, Kariesh cheese, Mish cheese, Kishk and Al-Samn was known by the Ancient Egyptians [7,8, 11-13]. After that, during the Egyptian, Arab Islamic periods (641 A.D until now), the manufacturing process of the Egyptian dairy products was well developed, and the modern automation processing took place in the large cities in both, lower and upper Egyptian governorates. The manufacturing process of the traditional dairy products in five frontier governorates must be intensive and is fully investigated, because it has not been previously studied [7, 8, 11]. The mammals whose milk is normally used for the manufacturing of the Egyptian dairy products are: buffalo (Bubalusbubalis) 63.5%, cow (Bos Taurus) 35.0%, sheep (Ovis Aries) 1.0%, goat (Capra hircus), 0.5% and the one hump camel (Arabian camel) (Camelus dromedaries). Very small amounts of camel milk are also produced [14]. It is believed that, buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel were introduced to Egypt since the Arab Islamic period (641. A.C.), while the cow is very well known in Egypt since the Pharaonic period [15]. | Department of Agricultural and Forestry, University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy *Corresponding Author: aldo.todaro@unipa.it | revealed that the addition of hydrocolloid increased moisture content and yield values of Kariesh cheese compared with controlled one. Low-fat cheeses such as Kariesh cheese reduced fat effects on its texture. Much research has been conducted to improve the texture of Kariesh cheese; most of them were designed to modify conventional cheese making technologies to increase moisture content, which improves texture [22]. | A lot of studies have proved that Kariesh cheese has the highest protein content (19.99Â±1.32 g/100g) among Egyptian cheeses. In regard to Double cream cheese, it has the lowest protein content (7.79Â±0.78 g/100g) meanwhile double cream cheese has the highest fat content (24.56Â±1.78 g/100g) while kariesh cheese has the lowest fat content (3.87Â±0.97 g/100g), and it is also reported that kariesh cheese has the highest moisture content with the lowest ash content (68.97Â±1.86 and 1.81Â±0.47 g/100g respectively). Kariesh cheese has a higher content of calcium and phosphorous (641.1Â±49.21 mg/100g, 431.18Â±37.21 mg/100g respectively) than the remaining types of cheese; as calcium and phosphorous content of Kariesh cheese, is almost the double content of the double cream cheese [20]. It is reported that average values of vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 in fresh Kariesh cheese were 0.06 mg/100g and 0.34 mg/100g respectively [17]. Mean vitamin levels in Kariesh cheese samples from Alexandria markets were (ug/100g): niacin 34.34, biotin 1.83, vitamin B12 0.15 and folic acid 3.10 [21]. Regarding the cheese texture, several hydrocolloids were used.

Egyptian Journal of Dairy Science,Vol. 1, 141-147, 1973. | Kariesh cheese is full of vitamins and minerals-iron, calcium, zinc and selenium that help protecting bones, body and health. It is one of the favorites for gym goers and body builders as it is low in fat and high in the right protein for lean muscle growth-casein. It is one of the best non-meat sources of protein around. The high protein content of Kariesh cheese and its high casein content make it a high satiety food so it reduces hunger for a long time. So it is a beneficial food for weight loss. Calcium in Kariesh cheese is important not only for building strong bones, but also for maintaining normal blood pressure. It is safe to eat during pregnancy. Each 100 g of kariesh cheese can provide children (1-8 y) with 80.14-128.22 % of their calcium needs while, for adults, the % is differ according to the age. It provides them from 49.32% (9-18 y) to 64.11% (19-50 y) [20]. | The presence of earthenware pots from 3200 B.C. to 332 B.C., tell us that kariesh cheese origin goes back to the Pharaonic period; assessed to what have been found in the Pyramids when they were first opened. Also, on a matmade of a type of reed, Juncus acutus, which is commonly used for the whey drain of Kariesh cheese and the earthenware pots Matrad or Shalia, Ballas or Zallas, Zeer and Barany and Kerbah (for butter making), were found in the tombs of the Greco-Roman Period (332 B.C-641 A.D.), near Sanoris | Kariesh cheese is made from defatted or skims cow or buffalo milk, or a mixture of both. Cow or buffalo are milked directly into special earthenware pots known as shalia, which are kept undisturbed in a suitable place to allow the fat to rise to the surface forming a cream layer (which is produced within 24-36 hours during the summer and two or three days during winter) and the partly skimmed milk sours and clots. Then the cream layer is removed, and the curd is poured onto a mat which is tied and hung with its contents, to allow the whey drain. This process of squeezing takes two or three days or until the desired texture of the cheese is obtained. Finally, the cheese is cut into suitable pieces, and salted cheese is left for a few hours on the mat till no more whey drains out, then it is ready to be consumed as fresh cheese. The shelf-life of the fresh cheese is between one and two weeks, while if it is pickled in brine earthenware pots; it keeps for up to a year [1, 4, 16]. Kariesh is also produced from the fermented milk, Laban Khad, or it is partially dehydrated variant, Laban Zeer (dehydrated during storage in porous earthenware jars through which water evaporates). Laban Khad is produced by fermenting milk in skin bags; after the milk has coagulated, the bags are shaken to gather the fat, which is removed, leaving behind Laban Khad in the bags. Apparently, rennet may be used to coagulate the milk in cold weather. Another technique is also used: coagulation of the blend of milk /buttermilk occurs naturally in 1-3 days. The coagulum is ladled onto mats (shanda) and the curd is left undisturbed for several hours: a small quantity of salt is sprinkled when the curd is firm enough. The mat, together with the curd, is rolled to facilitate wheying off. The curd is never pressed. This long cylindrical cheese is cut into pieces of equal size. If pickled in brine in earthenware pots, it keeps for up to a year: if it is intended for consumption as fresh | Kariesh Cheese acceptability depends on its appearance and sensory properties (flavour, texture, and colour). Among these, flavour is the most notable attribute for the consumer [32]. Many modifications have been tried to improve cheese quality. Fahmi [33] used combined acid and rennet coagulation, reporting that it gave Kariesh cheese a smooth texture and was more appealing than cheese made by the traditional method. It has been reported that carbonyl compounds and the volatile acids are mainly responsible for the odour and flavour of cheese, so the addition of citrate salt improved the quality of Kariesh cheese [34]. | Greco-Roman period from 332 to 641 A.C., and then passing through Arab Islamic period 641 A.C. until the present. Cheese making is a well-established tradition in Egypt: about eight types of cheeses are produced in Egypt, all of which originate from, and are still produced in, rural areas. Domiati is made industrially at milk plant level, and it is a white, pickled, soft and highly salted cheese [1]. The fat and SNF (Solid Not Fats) contents were standardized at 5 and 10% respectively [2]. Karish or Kariesh cheese is fresh and contains relatively low in salt [1]. Mish cheese is a soft pickled cheese without rind. Its body is yellowish to brown and has a close texture without eyeholes. It has a sharp and salty taste. Its shape is cylindrical (8-10 cm and 15 cm diameter) with a ridged surface [3]. Ras is a hard bacterially-ripened cheese; Brinza is a highly-salted cheese, Feta cheese of Russian origin and a small amount of Kashkaval are also produced and also other types are included as Domty (double-cream white fresh low salt cheese). Kariesh cheese is made from defatted milk (buffalo or cow milk or a mixture of both). Kariesh cheese contains most of the skim milk constituents including protein, a small amount of sugar, some water, soluble vitamins and most of calcium and phosphorus. The quality and composition of Kariesh cheese may vary considerably due to such factors as the quality and composition of the clotted skim milk, the method of manufacture, the time required to complete the whey drain, the quality of salt added and the method of handling finished cheese [4-9]. | Cheese plays an important role in the Egyptian diet, and many people eat a certain amount of cheese with at least one meal a day; most of the cheese is consumed either directly or with bread. It is reported that, since the Pharaonic era, from 3200 to 332 B.C., Egypt has been considered to be one of the most important leading countries in the manufacturing process of dairy products. It was developed in the | The authors are very grateful to Dr Giles O'Donovan for his technical advice in chemical analysis and useful | The increasing demand for Kariesh by Egyptian consumers is mainly attributed to its low price [15, 17]. | [13] Z.
